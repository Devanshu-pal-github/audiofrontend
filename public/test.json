Quick note before we dive in—Tina, great job on getting the Beacon walkthrough video live. It’s been shared in the product newsletter. First up, Beacon. Sam, status? Sure, we’re on track for the beta release this Friday. The auth module passed testing, and we’ve integrated payment APIs, but the analytics pipeline is delayed. We need DevOps help to patch the Kafka stream. Noted. Jake, can your team pick that up? Yes, I’ll assign it to Anjali. She’s wrapping up the cloud audit by tomorrow. Great. Let’s target Thursday EOD for that fix. Next—customer churn. Rachel, you had some numbers? Yes. Churn spiked by 3.2% in Tier 2 accounts. Top reasons: late feature delivery and response time from support. We’ll roll out a retention survey by next Wednesday and start user interviews from next Monday. Sounds good. Let's prioritize features based on survey insights. I’ll sync with design. Lastly, hiring roadmap. We need 3 backend engineers and 1 QA by April. Let’s fast-track referrals. I’ll draft a JD and share in Slack. Also, before we close—Kudos to Omar for refactoring the monolith into microservices. Add that to the company-wide kudos board. One last thing—please don’t push unreviewed code into staging. The build failed twice yesterday. Sorry, that was me. Won’t happen again. Alright, let’s close. Next sync: Thursday, same time."
